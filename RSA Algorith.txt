The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone.

The RSA algorithm is named after those who invented it in 1978: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

Working of RSA Algorithm:

The RSA algorithm ensures that the keys are as secure as possible. The following steps highlight how it works:

1. Generating the keys:

    i)   Select two large prime numbers, x and y. The prime numbers need to be large so that they will be difficult for someone to figure out.
    ii)  Calculate n=x∗y.
    iii) Calculate the totient function; ϕ(n)=(x−1)(y−1).
    iv)  Select an integer e, such that e is co-prime to ϕ(n) and 1<e<ϕ(n). The pair of numbers (n,e) makes up the public key.
    v)   Calculate d such that e.d = 1 mod ϕ(n).
    
    d can be found using the extended euclidean algorithm. The pair (n,d) makes up the private key.
    
2. Encryption:
    Given a plaintext P, represented as a number, the ciphertext C is calculated as:
          C= P^e mod n

3. Decryption:
    Using the private key (n,d), the plaintext can be found using:
          P= C^d mod n
