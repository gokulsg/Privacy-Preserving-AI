There are four Pillars of Perfectly-Privacy Preserving AI. They are:

Training Data Privacy: The guarantee that a malicious actor will not be able to reverse-engineer the training data.
Input Privacy: The guarantee that a userâ€™s input data cannot be observed by other parties, including the model creator.
Output Privacy: The guarantee that the output of a model is not visible by anyone except for the user whose data is being inferred upon.
Model Privacy: The guarantee that the model cannot be stolen by a malicious party.
